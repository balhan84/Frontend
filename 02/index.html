        <strong>PARIS</strong>
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <p> <strong> <em>This article is about the capital of France. For other uses, see Paris (disambiguation).</em></strong> <br> 
    <hr> Paris is the capital and most populous city of France. With an official estimated population of 2,102,650 residents as of 1 January 2023[2] in an area of more than 105 km2 (41 sq mi),[5] Paris is the fourth-most populated city in the European Union and the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2022.[6] Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, and gastronomy. For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and extensive system of street lighting, in the 19th century, it became known as the City of Light.[7] <a href="addinform.html" target="_blank"><strong>more information</strong></a>

        <strong>Etymology</strong>
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The ancient oppidum that corresponds to the modern city of Paris was first mentioned in the mid-1st century BC by Julius Caesar as Luteciam Parisiorum ('Lutetia of the Parisii'), and is later attested as Parision in the 5th century AD, then as Paris in 1265.[19][20] During the Roman period, it was commonly known as Lutetia or Lutecia in Latin, and as Leukotekía in Greek, which is interpreted as either stemming from the Celtic root *lukot- ('mouse'), or from *luto- ('marsh, swamp').

        <strong>History</strong>
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The Parisii, a sub-tribe of the Celtic Senones, inhabited the Paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC.[26][27] One of the area's major north–south trade routes crossed the Seine on the île de la Cité, which gradually became an important trading centre.[28] The Parisii traded with many river towns (some as far away as the Iberian Peninsula) and minted their own coins.[29] <br>
    Gold coins minted by the Parisii (1st century BC).The Romans conquered the Paris Basin in 52 BC and began their settlement on Paris's Left Bank.[30] The Roman town was originally called Lutetia (more fully, Lutetia Parisiorum, "Lutetia of the Parisii", modern French Lutèce). It became a prosperous city with a forum, baths, temples, theatres, and an amphitheatre.</p>

        <strong>Geography</strong>
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    <strong>Location</strong><br>Paris is located in northern central France, in a north-bending arc of the river Seine whose crest includes two islands, the Île Saint-Louis and the larger Île de la Cité, which form the oldest part of the city. The river's mouth on the English Channel (La Manche) is about 233 mi (375 km) downstream from the city. The city is spread widely on both banks of the river.[95] Overall, the city is relatively flat, and the lowest point is 35 m (115 ft) above sea level. Paris has several prominent hills, the highest of which is Montmartre at 130 m (427 ft). <br> 
    <strong>Climate</strong> <br>According to the Köppen climate classification, Paris has an oceanic climate, typical of western Europe. This climate type features cool winters that have frequent rain and overcast skies, and mild to warm summers. Very hot and very cold temperatures and weather extremes are rare in this type of climate.[100] <br>
    Summer days are usually mild and pleasant with average temperatures between 15 and 25 °C (59 and 77 °F), and a fair amount of sunshine.[101] Each year, however, there are a few days when the temperature rises above 32 °C (90 °F). Longer periods of more intense heat sometimes occur, such as the heat wave of 2003 when temperatures exceeded 30 °C (86 °F) for weeks, reached 40 °C (104 °F) on some days and rarely cooled down at night.[102] Spring and autumn have, on average, mild days and cool nights but are changing and unstable. Surprisingly warm or cool weather occurs frequently in both seasons.[103] In winter, sunshine is scarce; days are cool, and nights are cold but generally above freezing with low temperatures around 3 °C (37 °F). </p>

        <strong>Culture</strong>
    </h3>   
     <p><strong>Painting and sculpture</strong> <br>For centuries, Paris has attracted artists from around the world. As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the "City of Art".[211] Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royal family commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era. Sculptors such as Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France. Pierre Mignard became the first painter to King Louis XIV during this period. In 1648, the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served as France's top art school until 1793.</p>
